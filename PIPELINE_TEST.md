# 🧪 CI/CD Pipeline Test

This file was created to test the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

**Test Details:**
- Created: $(Get-Date)
- Branch: test-cicd-pipeline
- Purpose: Verify automated testing and deployment workflows

**Expected Behavior:**
1. ✅ GitHub Actions should trigger automatically
2. ✅ Run Flutter tests and analysis
3. ✅ Perform security scanning
4. ✅ Build web application (if secrets configured)
5. ⚠️ May fail at deployment step if Firebase secrets not configured

**Next Steps:**
1. Check GitHub Actions tab for workflow status
2. Configure Firebase secrets if deployment fails
3. Monitor pipeline execution and logs

This test validates that our CI/CD infrastructure is working correctly!
